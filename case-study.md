# Axion Labs Case Study

**Industry:** Metal Manufacturing  
**Client:** Axion Labs, owned and operated by Bryan Lahoud

---

## Company Background

Axion Labs specializes in precision metal manufacturing for a wide range of contractors. As the company scaled, the volume of incoming job offers grew substantially, making it increasingly challenging to evaluate opportunities quickly and accurately.

---

## The Challenge

Bryan Lahoud and his team were spending significant time reviewing every job offer manually. Each proposal required checking:

- The relevant metal certifications.
- Current metal pricing and cost feasibility.
- Profit margins, scheduling, and available resources.

This manual process delayed response times, risking lost opportunities and potentially strained relationships with contractors. Timely decision-making and accurate cost analysis were critical to maintaining Axion’s competitive edge.

## Objectives

1. **Reduce evaluation time** for incoming job offers.
2. **Automate repetitive checks** to free staff for higher-value tasks.
3. **Track and analyze trends** in accepted vs. declined jobs to inform future strategy.
4. **Lay the groundwork for AI-assisted decision-making** to improve accuracy and profitability.

## The Solution

Working closely with Axion Labs, we introduced a streamlined software system to automate key steps:

- **Automated Job Offer Verification:** Integrated workflows now check certifications, pricing, and profitability.
- **Instant Summaries:** A direct notification system highlights the key points of each offer and provides an acceptance recommendation.
- **Data Collection & Analytics:** Every job decision—accepted or declined—is logged, enabling insights such as acceptance rates, busiest production days, common rejection reasons, and overall financial trends.
- **Future-Ready AI Framework:** The collected data is being used to train a predictive AI model to further enhance decision accuracy.

## Results

- **85% accuracy** in predicting which jobs should be accepted.
- **Faster turnaround times** for contractor responses, improving client satisfaction.
- **5,000+ jobs analyzed**, providing a robust dataset for ongoing improvements.
- Noticeable **increase in operational efficiency and production output**.

## Key Learnings

- Enhanced expertise in **Python development**, **data structures**, and **database infrastructure**.
- Practical experience in **business process automation** and **AI implementation**.
- Improved problem-solving skills and **cross-functional collaboration** between technical and operations teams.

## Future Outlook

Axion Labs plans to expand automation to additional operational areas and fully deploy the AI decision-support system. This will further reduce overhead, improve forecasting, and strengthen relationships with contractors.
