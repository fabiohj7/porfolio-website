# Ace Of Fades Digital Punch Card

Working on the One Cut Above website was a valuable learning experience. The final result impressed the owner enough that he wanted to expand its features—leading to the idea of a **digital punch card system**.

## Problem

RJ wanted an easy way to track how often clients visit for haircuts and to reward his most loyal customers.

He envisioned a **digital punch card**: clients would tap a card on their phones, and the website would record the visit. After a set number of punches, the client would earn a free haircut.

## Solution

RJ’s idea immediately brought **NFC cards** to mind. These cards could be tapped against any smartphone, opening a link to the website where the punch would be recorded automatically. The system would display each client’s progress toward their reward while providing RJ with a **reliable and cost-effective** way to manage customer loyalty.

### Login System

The login process will be straightforward: clients will provide their **full name**, **phone number**, and **email address**. This keeps the required information minimal while maintaining open communication channels.

All customer details and punch records will be stored securely in a database.

### Data Processing

Both clients and the admin will have tools to **view punch history**.

- **Clients** can track their progress toward free services.
- **Admins** will see a table of all registered clients for easy management and customer tracking.

### Anti-Cheat System

As with any rewards program, there’s potential for abuse. To prevent fraud, an **anti-cheat system** will verify punches to ensure that only legitimate visits are rewarded. The admin’s table view will also assist in spotting suspicious activity.

### Future Development

Over time, the collected data could be analyzed to provide valuable business insights. Possible improvements include:

- Identifying peak hours and busy days.
- Tracking customer visit frequency.
- Informing marketing and operational strategies.

This data-driven approach could help **One Cut Above** refine its business strategy and improve customer engagement.
